# Drink Recorder

Python program that records the amount of standard US alcoholic drinks a given participant consumes on a certain day.
Using this information, graphical charts will be used to display certain characteristics over a set period of time.

### Graphs:
**Chart 1 - Timeline:**
Provides a timeline where each date creates a histogram containing the amount of drinks consumed by each
participant on that given date.

**Chart 2 - Pie Graph:**
Creates a pie graph that compares each participant's consumption of drinks in relation to the total amount consumed by 
all participants.

### Calculations:
Inputs contains the amount of US ounces a person consumes as well as the alcoholic percentage the liquid contains.

Common measurements for 1 standard US drink:
> Beer: 12 fl oz at 5% alcohol.  
> Malt Liquor: 8-9 fl oz at 7% alcohol.  
> Wine: 5 fl oz at 12% alcohol.  
> Spirit: 1.5 fl oz at 40% alcohol.  
>
> Each standard drink amounts to 0.6 fl oz of 100% alcohol.

Using this, calculations are performed that are added to the records for each participant.
